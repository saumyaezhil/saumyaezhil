Hi there! I’m Saumya from Bangalore. I’m passionate about robotics 🤖 and have just started exploring web development 🌐.
My journey is all about curiosity—I love tinkering with robotic projects and figuring out how things work.

Currently, I’m diving into different technologies and enjoying the learning process. I’m excited to share my projects here and collaborate with fellow developers!
